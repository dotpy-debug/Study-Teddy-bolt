# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Study Teddy is a comprehensive AI-powered study planner that helps students organize their study time and get instant help with questions. The platform combines task management with an AI study assistant to create a complete learning environment. This PRD build consolidates all existing documentation into a unified, actionable product requirements document that serves as the single source of truth for the Study Teddy platform. The implementation will follow the existing tech stack (NestJS backend + React/Vite frontend + PostgreSQL) while utilizing the styling, CSS, and design patterns from the old.study folder for consistent visual presentation.
