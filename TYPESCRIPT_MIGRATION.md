# TypeScript Strict Mode Migration Plan

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Completed)
- [x] Install missing dependencies (@types/node, zod, class-validator)
- [x] Create basic type definitions
- [x] Temporarily disable strict ESLint rules
- [x] Fix import/export issues

## Phase 2: Gradual Type Safety (Next Steps)
- [ ] Replace 'any' types with proper interfaces (start with API responses)
- [ ] Add proper error handling types
- [ ] Fix React component prop types
- [ ] Add proper database query types

## Phase 3: Full Type Safety (Future)
- [ ] Enable strict TypeScript mode
- [ ] Re-enable strict ESLint rules
- [ ] Add comprehensive type tests
- [ ] Document type conventions

## Files to Prioritize:
1. apps/frontend/lib/api-client.ts - Core API client
2. apps/frontend/hooks/use-*.ts - Custom hooks
3. apps/backend/src/modules/*/services - Business logic
4. packages/shared/src/types - Shared type definitions

## Commands to Run After This Script:
```bash
# Install dependencies
bun install

# Type check (should have fewer errors now)
bun run typecheck

# Lint with relaxed rules
bun run lint

# Build to verify everything works
bun run build
```
