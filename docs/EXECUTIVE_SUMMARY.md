## 🔥 Key Implementation Insights

### Architecture Decisions
1. **Monorepo Strategy**: Shared types eliminate API mismatches, faster development
2. **Next.js App Router**: Server-side rendering, better SEO, improved performance
3. **React Query**: Optimistic updates, caching, offline support
4. **Component Migration**: Priority-based approach ensures MVP functionality first

### Risk Mitigation
1. **Parallel Development**: Keep old.study running during migration
2. **Incremental Migration**: Component-by-component reduces breaking changes
3. **Type Safety**: Shared types prevent API integration issues
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Early optimization prevents late-stage surprises

### Success Enablers
1. **Clear Priorities**: Focus on MVP features first, polish later
2. **Existing Assets**: Rich UI components ready for migration
3. **Proven Backend**: 85% complete backend reduces integration risk
4. **Modern Stack**: Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind for rapid development
