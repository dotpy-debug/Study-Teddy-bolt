  }

  selectGreeting(timeOfDay: string, userHistory: UserHistory): string {
    // Context-aware greeting selection
  }

  detectUserMood(userInput: string, behaviorData: BehaviorData): UserMood {
    // Mood detection based on input and behavior
  }
}
```

#### Animation Controller
```typescript

  }

  processAnimationQueue(): void {
    // Handle animation transitions and sequences
  }

  respectReducedMotion(): boolean {
    // Check user's reduced motion preferences
  }
}
```

### CSS Implementation

#### Base Styles
```css
/* styles/teddy-character.css */
.teddy-character {
  display: inline-block;
  position: relative;
  transition: all 0.3s ease-in-out;

  /* Respect reduced motion preferences */
  @media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
    animation: none !important;

    * {
      animation: none !important;
      transition: none !important;
    }
  }
}

/* Size variations */
.teddy-character--compact {
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
}

.teddy-character--normal {
  width: 80px;
  height: 80px;
}

.teddy-character--large {
  width: 120px;
  height: 120px;
}

/* Context-specific positioning */
.teddy-character--chat {
  margin-right: 8px;
}

.teddy-character--notification {
  position: absolute;
  top: -5px;
  right: -5px;
}

.teddy-character--sidebar {
  margin-bottom: 4px;
}
```

#### Animation Definitions
```css
/* Animation keyframes for all states */
@keyframes teddy-idle { /* ... */ }
@keyframes teddy-happy { /* ... */ }
@keyframes teddy-thinking { /* ... */ }
@keyframes teddy-encouraging { /* ... */ }
@keyframes teddy-celebrating { /* ... */ }
@keyframes teddy-concerned { /* ... */ }
@keyframes teddy-sleeping { /* ... */ }

/* Utility animations */
@keyframes pulse {
  0%, 100% { opacity: 1; }
  50% { opacity: 0.7; }
}

@keyframes float {
  0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0); }
  50% { transform: translateY(-5px); }
}

@keyframes confetti {
  0% { transform: translateY(0) scale(1); opacity: 1; }
  100% { transform: translateY(-30px) scale(1.2); opacity: 0; }
}
```

### Integration Points

#### Chat Interface Integration
```typescript
// In AIPage component
import { TeddyCharacter } from '@/components/ai/TeddyCharacter';

      updateTeddyState('thinking');
    } else if (lastResponseWasPositive) {
      updateTeddyState('happy');
    }
  }, [isLoading, lastResponseWasPositive]);

  return (
    <div className="chat-interface">

## üåç Cultural Sensitivity & Accessibility

### Cultural Considerations

#### Universal Design Principles
- **Color Independence**: Never rely solely on color to convey information
- **Cultural Neutrality**: Avoid culture-specific gestures or symbols
- **Language Inclusivity**: Support multiple languages and cultural contexts
- **Religious Sensitivity**: Avoid religious symbols or references

#### Inclusive Character Design
```css
/* Ensure cultural neutrality in design */
.teddy-character {
  /* Neutral, warm colors that work across cultures */
  --teddy-primary: oklch(0.6 0.15 45);

  /* Avoid culture-specific clothing or accessories */
  /* Keep facial features simple and universal */
  /* Use gesture and posture that are universally positive */
}
```

#### Localization Support
```typescript
// i18n/teddy-responses.ts
export const teddyResponses = {
  en: {
    greetings: {
      morning: "Good morning! Ready to learn something amazing today?",
      afternoon: "Hello there! What shall we explore together?",
      evening: "Good evening! How can I help with your studies?"
    },
    encouragement: {
      struggling: "It's okay to find this challenging! Every expert was once a beginner.",
      progress: "You're making great progress! Keep up the excellent work!",
      achievement: "Fantastic! Your hard work is really paying off!"
    }
  },
  es: {
    greetings: {
      morning: "¬°Buenos d√≠as! ¬øListo para aprender algo incre√≠ble hoy?",
      afternoon: "¬°Hola! ¬øQu√© exploraremos juntos?",
      evening: "¬°Buenas tardes! ¬øC√≥mo puedo ayudarte con tus estudios?"
    }
  }
  // Additional languages...
};
```

### Accessibility Features

#### Screen Reader Support
```typescript
// Accessibility attributes for Teddy character
<div
  className="teddy-character"
  role="img"
  aria-label={`Study Teddy is ${currentState}. ${getStateDescription(currentState)}`}
  aria-describedby="teddy-status"
>
  <svg aria-hidden="true">
    {/* SVG content */}
  </svg>

  <div id="teddy-status" className="sr-only">
    {getDetailedStateDescription(currentState, context)}
  </div>
</div>

// Screen reader descriptions
function getStateDescription(state: TeddyState): string {
  const descriptions = {
    idle: "ready to help with your studies",
    happy: "celebrating your success",
    thinking: "processing your question",
    encouraging: "cheering you on",
    celebrating: "excited about your achievement",
    concerned: "offering support",
    sleeping: "resting while you take a break"
  };
  return descriptions[state];
}
```

#### Reduced Motion Support
```css
/* Respect user's motion preferences */
@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce) {
  .teddy-character,
  .teddy-character * {
    animation-duration: 0.01ms !important;
    animation-iteration-count: 1 !important;
    transition-duration: 0.01ms !important;
  }

  /* Provide alternative visual feedback */
  .teddy-character[data-state="happy"]::after {
    content: "üòä";
    position: absolute;
    top: -10px;
    right: -10px;
  }

  .teddy-character[data-state="thinking"]::after {
    content: "ü§î";
    position: absolute;
    top: -10px;
    right: -10px;
  }
}
```

#### High Contrast Support
```css
/* High contrast mode support */
@media (prefers-contrast: high) {
  .teddy-character {
    --teddy-primary: #000000;
    --teddy-secondary: #ffffff;
    --teddy-accent: #0066cc;
    filter: contrast(150%);
  }
}

/* Windows High Contrast mode */
@media screen and (-ms-high-contrast: active) {
  .teddy-character {
    forced-color-adjust: none;
    outline: 2px solid ButtonText;
  }
}
```

#### Focus Management
```css
/* Keyboard navigation support */
.teddy-character:focus-visible {
  outline: 2px solid var(--color-ring);
  outline-offset: 2px;
  border-radius: 4px;
}

/* Focus indicators for interactive elements */
.teddy-character[tabindex="0"] {
  cursor: pointer;
}

.teddy-character:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
  transition: transform 0.2s ease-in-out;
}
```

#### Text Alternative for Visual States
```typescript
// Provide text alternatives for all visual states
const visualStateAlternatives = {
  animations: {
    happy: "Teddy is bouncing with joy",
    thinking: "Teddy is pondering with a thought bubble",
    celebrating: "Teddy is jumping with confetti around",
    concerned: "Teddy has a worried expression",
    encouraging: "Teddy is giving a thumbs up",
    sleeping: "Teddy is peacefully sleeping with Z's floating nearby"
  },

  colors: {
    happy: "bright and cheerful colors",
    concerned: "muted, supportive colors",
    celebrating: "vibrant, festive colors"
  }
};
```
